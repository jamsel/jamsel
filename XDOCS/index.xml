          <p>
	  The JAMSEL framework provides a complete implementation of the JMS selector facility as defined by the JMS specification 1.1. The
	  framework is transport-neutral and can be used by any application that requires support for a flexible conditional expression 
	  syntax. The data source is abstracted behind the <code>IValueProvider</code> interface - any class that implements this interface 
        may be used to drive the selector.
	  </p>
        <p>
	  The framework provides direct support, in the form of classes that implement the <code>IValueProvider</code> interface,
        for a number of data types. Currently, the framework provides out of the box support for <a href="www.tibco.com" target="_blank">TIBCO/RV</a>, 
        JMS, and <code>Map</code>.
	  </p>
    	  <p>
        For more information on getting started with the framework see the 
	  <a href="./start/index.html">Getting Started</a> guide.

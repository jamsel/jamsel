      <p>
      JAMSEL is currently distributed in two formats for user convenience:
      a tar/gzipped install archive and a zipped install archive. Each of the 
	install archives contains everything that Selector needs to run except
	for the JARs from TIBCO. If you are using features of JAMSEL that
	require the use of <a href="http://www.tibco.com">TIBCO/Rendezvous</a>
	then you will have to make sure that these JARs are in your CLASSPATH.
      </p>
	<p>
	You can find the install archives <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jamsel">here</a>.

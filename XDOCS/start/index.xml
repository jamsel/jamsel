    <section name="Getting Started with JAMSEL">
      <p>
        This document (as well as the others in this section) provide
        an introduction to JAMSEL and how to use it within a project.
        For those that have already skimmed the documentation on this
        site, you may be asking yourself, what *exactly* does it mean to
        use JAMSEL?  These documents attempt to illustrate how one might 
        install, integrate and leverage the power of JAMSEL in a project.
      </p>

      <p>
        To avoid overwhelming you (user, developer, or contributor) with
        unnecessary information, this document attempts to provide
        references to various documents depending upon your  
        interests.  It is meant to provide you with a starting point
        that can be effectively used to get to the information you need
        without going through all of the documentation on the site,
        which might be a little overwhelming.

              Before you can start using JAMSEL in any form, you'll have
              to download the JAMSEL distribution to your system (unless
              you plan on building JAMSEL from source).  This document
              provides links to the various distributions available.

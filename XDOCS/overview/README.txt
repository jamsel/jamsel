Getting started:

Now that you have installed the selector framework do the following:

1) TIBCO Rendezvous:

	The framework provides full support for working with the TIBCO/Rendezvous product. Specifically, the
	framework supports extracting field values from TIBCO/Rendezvous messages.In order to use the TIBCO/Rendezvous 
	functionality of the framework one additional JAR is required: tibrvj.jar. Clients are expected to have access 
        to this JAR (version 6.0 or higher) and the necessary TIBCO/Rendezvous runtime license files. To download an 
        evaluation copy of the TIBCO/Rendezvous product see http://www.tibco.com/solutions/products/active_enterprise/rv.
